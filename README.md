## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects and snippets in multiple programming languages. Each folder corresponds to a different language or technology. These files range from simple "Hello, World!" programs to more complex projects and exercises.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by language or technology, with each having its own folder. Here's an example of the structure:


## Languages and Technologies

Currently, the repository includes examples and projects in the following languages and technologies:

- **Python**: Scripts and projects demonstrating basic to advanced concepts.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend and backend examples.
- **Java**: Core Java programs and algorithms.
- **C++**: Fundamental programs and data structures.
- **BashScripting** Fundamentals of bash scripting 
- **More to come**: As I continue to learn, more languages and technologies will be added.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the files and folders to see the various examples. If you're interested in running any of the code, make sure you have the necessary environment set up for the specific language.

### Running Python Scripts

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the `Python` folder.
3. Run the script using `python filename.py`.

### Running JavaScript Files

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed for backend scripts.
2. Navigate to the `JavaScript` folder.
3. Run the script using `node filename.js`.

### Running Java Programs

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Navigate to the `Java` folder.
3. Compile the program using `javac filename.java`.
4. Run the program using `java filename`.

### Running C++ Programs

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++).
2. Navigate to the `C++` folder.
3. Compile the program using `g++ filename.cpp -o filename`.
4. Run the program using `./filename`.
